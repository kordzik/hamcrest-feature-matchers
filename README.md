# Hamcrest Feature Matchers

TODO

# TODO

* proper name / package?
* test other variants of GenerateFeatureMatchers
* test clash between getter and no-getter etc (each variant)
* support generic types? in particular should work with iterable matchers well
* custom method filter
* composite feature methods (using @Feature)
* test error conditions - need to spawn compiler process inside the test?
* use javapoet to write source
* support nested static classes (generate inside top matcher class)
* support arrays and other type kinds?
